          <p>Follow these simple steps to craft the perfect resume:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Upload Your Documents:</strong> Start by uploading your current resume, cover letters, or any other relevant documents. The more information you provide, the better the result.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add Personal Stories (The Secret Weapon):</strong> This is the step most people miss when building a resume. Think about projects or experiences, even non-work related ones, where you learned a skill. These personal stories are fantastic ways to share skills you didn't even realize you could put on your resumeâ€”skills that could help your odds of landing that job interview. Don't be shy!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Paste the Job Description:</strong> Copy the entire job description from the company's listing and paste it into the third box. This allows the AI to tailor your resume directly to the employer's needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Choose Your Sections:</strong> Select the resume sections you want to appear in the final document. We've pre-selected the most common ones for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generate & Download:</strong> Click the "Generate My CV" button. Review the result and, when you're happy, download it as a PDF.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
